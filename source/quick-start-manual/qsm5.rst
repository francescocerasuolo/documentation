Upload Your Own Data and Tools
------------------------------

Upload your data
================

You have the following options regarding your own dataset which you want to use on the platform:

* request upload of your dataset on the platform and make it available for all users or selected community as a new product
* request upload of your dataset on the platform and make it available for all users or selected community as a new dataset for processing (using existing processors or custom processors)
* request upload of your dataset on the platform and make it available just for your processing (using existing processors or custom processors)
* request publication of the dataset you have generated on the platform as a new product for all users or selected community 

These options are available only to the registered users after sign-on using your EO-SSO ID. When you log into the platform you can find the appropriate request forms on the "Develop and offer content" page.

..NOTE:: 
	There are only two request forms regarding the uploading or publishing of a dataset. These forms are the entry point for the whole process as they generate new request ticket within the platform's helpdesk system. The helpdesk operator is automatically informed about the new ticket and the following dataset/request specific communitation is performed using this ticketing system.

Request upload of a dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill the "Requesting upload of a user-provided dataset" form to upload your dataset for the publication as a product or as a dataset for processing.

You will be contacted by a selected processing center operator via the helpdesk system about the method of the dataset upload. The processing center operator ingests the data e.g. by harvesting it from a remote location, or by offering you an FTP drop-down point for the processing center. In the end, the help desk operator informs you about the finalisation of your request.
	
Request publication of a dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill the "Requesting publication of a dataset" form to publish the dataset you have generated on the platform as a new product.
