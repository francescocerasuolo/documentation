Support
=======

The support page is accessible from the |question_mark.png| icon on the top menu bar. It gives the possibility to a user to have access to
the list of existing support tickets or to create a new one (by clicking on **New issue**). Clicking on the Title of the ticket will redirect to the redmine support page.

During the creation of a new ticket, from the interface you can set the Subject, the Priority as well as the Description. The Assignee will be by default the Tep Urban support team. 
The ticket can be updated with more details directly on the redmine support page.
