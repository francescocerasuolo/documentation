======================================================

GeoBrowser
----------

The GeoBrowser is composed of:

	- a `Map`_, where the user can make search query and see results
	- `Contexts`_ links
	- `Results`_ tab (initialy hidden)
	- `Processing services tab`_ (initialy hidden)

Map
~~~

The map is just a simple map, on which you can zoom in, zoom out and navigate.

Some buttons maybe used to interact with the map:

-  |geobrowser_button_search.png| search area
-  |geobrowser_button_plus.png| Zoom in
-  |geobrowser_button_minus.png| Zoom out
-  |geobrowser_button_query.png| Open query search tab
-  |geobrowser_button_polygon.png| Edit the search bbox by drawing a polygon on the map
-  |geobrowser_button_recbox.png| Edit the search bbox by drawing a rectangle on the map
-  |geobrowser_button_dynamicsearch.png| Enable/Disable dynamic search (the search bbox is the current view on the map)
-  |geobrowser_button_fullscreen.png| Put the map in full screen
-  |geobrowser_button_layers.png| Change the background of the map | Select layers to be displayed.

.. req:: TS-FUN-280

	This section describe the area of interest definition by geometry.


It is also possible to directly select on the map the temporal parameter of the search by moving the temporal bar.

.. tip:: in the *Search Term* field supported wildcards are '*', which matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and '?', which matches any single character.

It is also possible to add layers on the map:

Data Results layer
******************

Display the results (orange polygons) of the current search or context.

City population layer

Display a circle over most populated cities. The circle size is related to the population of the city.

Contexts
~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_contexts.png
	:figclass: img-border

Some pre-defined context are accessible on the top of the map.
One context is the result of a query on a specific catalog with pre-defined search parameters.
The existing pre-defined contexts are:

- EO data
- EO processing
- Publications
- Community

Results
~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_resulttab.png
	:figclass: img-border img-max-width

The result tab is divided in two parts:

- On the left, the **Results Table** showing the list of current results displayed on the map. Results are paginatd, only 20 items are displayed, select another page to discover more products.
- On the right, the **Features Basket** showing all data in the current basket as well as the data package view, showing all available data packages for the current user with the possibility to load it / use as search.

.. req:: TS-FUN-270
	:show:

	This section describe the data package web widget.

Results can be dragged fron the left table to the basket. Then the basket can be saved as a new data package and shared with other users.
Saved Data packages can then be loaded into the basket. (see :doc:`data <../data>` for more details)


Cloud Processing
----------------

Processing services tab can be expanded by clicking on *Processing Services* on the right of the map.
It is composed of two sub tabs.

Processing services tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab contains the list of available Processing Services. Usually, only 20 Processing services are displayed. If you are looking for a specific one, you can filter the results using the **Filter services** input.

Jobs tab
~~~~~~~~

This tab contains the list of available jobs associated to your user.
Details on jobs can be accessed by clicking on the title of the job.
