- go to the control panel / wps services view and check that one or more new services are created, linked to this new wps provider and check they have as domain the user private domain
- if necessary, set the availability of the service to true (or false if the user must not see it)
- the user should now be able to see the service(s) in the Thematic Application **Test my processor**
